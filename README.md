# Test Suez Consulting

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.11.

It's a test for Suez Consulting, which consist to create an angular app using Angular CLI, resuming my different experiences and myself.

## Requirements

Be sure to have on your machine `npm` and `node` installed

## Installation

To run the project start by launching the commande `npm install` to install the node packages.
Then use the command `ng serve` to launch the project.

You can now go to your browser and write `http://localhost:4200/` to see the project.
